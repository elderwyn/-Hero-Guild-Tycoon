## Mission Notes
- Missions can have **recommended unit types** for optimal rewards.  
- Every mission **guarantees a reward** (gold, XP, or loot), even if not completed optimally.  
- Missions scale in difficulty and reward as the guild grows.


### Unit Influence on Mission Outcome

Each mission dynamically calculates outcomes based on **unit selection and synergy**.  

### Factors Affecting Success
| Factor | Effect |
|--------|-------|
| **Unit Role Match** | Using recommended roles increases reward multiplier (e.g., 10-20%) |
| **Empire Synergy** | Units from the player’s empire provide small bonus to success |
| **Ability Usage** | Certain unit abilities can **reduce mission duration** or **increase loot quality** |
| **Unit Level / Star Rating** | Higher-level units increase gold, XP, and item drop rates |
| **Team Composition** | Mixing roles (Tank/DPS/Support) can unlock hidden bonuses (e.g., crit loot, XP boost) |

### Example Scenarios
1. **Bandit Raid** – Recommended: 2 Tanks + 2 DPS  
   - Using recommended units → +20% gold and rare loot drop  
   - Using only DPS → Mission completes slower, lower XP reward  
   - Using units outside recommended roles → Mission still completes, base reward only  

2. **Dungeon Expedition** – Recommended: 1 Tank + 1 Support + 2 DPS  
   - Includes mechanics for **healing, shielding, or AoE damage**  
   - Support or healer absent → minor reduction in XP and loot quality  
   - Extra Tanks → small bonus to gold, but longer mission time  

3. **Empire-Specific Quest** – Only units from selected empire can unlock **special cosmetic or bonus reward**.  
   - Other units can still complete mission → standard rewards, no unique unlocks.
